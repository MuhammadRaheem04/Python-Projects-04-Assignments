# Write a program which asks a user for their age and lets them know if they can or can't vote in the following three fictional countries.

# the voting age in Peturksbouipo is 16 
# the voting age in Stanlau is 25
# the voting age in Mayengua is 48 

# Your code should prompt the for their age and print whether or not they can vote in Peturksbouipo, Stanlau, or Mayengua.

# Here's a sample run of the program:

# How old are you? 20 You can vote in Peturksbouipo where the voting age is 16. You cannot vote in Stanlau where the voting age is 25. You cannot vote in Mayengua where the voting age is 48.


# Solution 

PETURKSBOUIPO_AGE : int = 16
STANLAU_AGE : int = 25
MAYENGUA_AGE : int = 48

def main():
    # Get the user's age
    user_age = int(input("How old are you? "))

    # Check if the user can vote in Peturksbouipo
    if user_age >= PETURKSBOUIPO_AGE:
        print(f"You can vote in Peturksbouipo where the voting age is {PETURKSBOUIPO_AGE}.")
    else:
        print(f"You cannot vote in Peturksbouipo where the voting age is {PETURKSBOUIPO_AGE}.")
    
    # Check if the user can vote in Stanlau
    if user_age >= STANLAU_AGE:
        print(f"You can vote in Stanlau where the voting age is {STANLAU_AGE}.")
    else:
        print(f"You cannot vote in Stanlau where the voting age is {STANLAU_AGE}.")
    
    # Check if user can vote in Mayengua
    if user_age >= MAYENGUA_AGE:
        print(f"You can vote in Mayengua where the voting age is {MAYENGUA_AGE}.")
    else:
        print(f"You cannot vote in Mayengua where the voting age is {MAYENGUA_AGE}.")
